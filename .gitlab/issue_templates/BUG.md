## The Problem

Briefly describe the issue you are experiencing (or the feature you want to see added to Project). Tell us what you were trying to do and what happened instead. Remember, this is _not_ a place to ask questions.

## Steps to reproduce

(How one can reproduce the issue - this is very important)

## Details

If necessary, describe the problem you have been experiencing in more detail.

### Environment

- OS: {Please write here}
- zsh-starship version: {Please write here}

### Link to Project logs

Create a [snippets](https://gitlab.com/dashboard/snippets) which is a paste of your _full_ Project logs, and link them here.
Do _NOT_ paste your full Project logs here, as it will make this issue very long and hard to read!
If you are reporting a bug, _always_ include Project logs!
